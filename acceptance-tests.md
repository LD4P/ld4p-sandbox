# Sinopia Implementation Acceptance Tests


Sinopia Work Cycle 1 User Acceptance Tests are in this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12BhrybKhFuaQ9-7cFIZTrbvJukox__InOFexQyGCVQY/) for easy sorting and for printing to use as a manual testing checklist.

Some of the tests refer to examples in a demo profile [ConfigurationDemoFuller.json](https://github.com/LD4P/sinopia_sample_profiles/blob/master/configuration_demo/ConfigurationDemoFuller.json). Here's a quick reference to the configurations that are found in that demo [Key to ConfigurationDemoFuller.json](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V0yNUMBV5W4Hv1KU455tq4-APW190hUWuqBbyrZYVls/edit#gid=0)
